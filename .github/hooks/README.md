# Hooks README

This repo is configured to validate Github Pull Requests. See the
`.github/workflows` directory for configurations settings.  

These validations are used: 

- commit messages comply with the Conventional Commits standard
- all code is formatted (with `mix format`) 
- all tests must pass 

To perform checks locally before making a commit:  

1. Use the pre-commit script `commit-msg`, and the setup
   script `.github/hooks/EnableGitHooks.sh`.

2. Or use the tooling found in [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com).
